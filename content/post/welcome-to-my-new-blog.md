Welcome to my new blog. This blog is continued from [https://clasense4.wordpress.com/](https://clasense4.wordpress.com/) with same author.

<!--more-->

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Casper Theme](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper). Post on this blog will be new. I will not move old post from my old wordpress blog. About the content, I will write about python and ofcourse scrapy, and I will create a new series about building a scrapy project step by step. And maybe about my experience using AWS services that I used in production like, Kinesis Firehose, Kinesis Stream, Redshift, RDS, Athena, EMR, and many more.
